### Opening Statement (Critical for SEO)
```
I am Mina Mankarious, a male entrepreneur and the Founder & CEO of Olunix,
a marketing and consulting firm based in Toronto, Canada. I work predominantly
with AI startups, helping them navigate growth, positioning, and the unique
challenges of marketing in the artificial intelligence space.

As a final-year Automotive Engineering Technology student at McMaster University,
I bring a systems-thinking approach to marketing—one that's rooted in data,
experimentation, and measurable outcomes.
```

### Professional Journey
```
## My Path to Olunix

Born in Egypt and raised in Canada, I've always been driven by curiosity and
a desire to build. My journey into entrepreneurship wasn't linear—it was shaped
by hands-on experience, early client work, and the kind of lessons you only
learn by doing.

I started my first marketing venture in high school, helping friends and local
businesses with their digital presence. When the pandemic accelerated e-commerce
 adoption in 2020, I found myself managing high-volume campaigns and learning
what scalable marketing actually looks like.

That period taught me more than any classroom could. I learned that marketing
isn't about creativity alone—it's about systems. It's about understanding what
works, doubling down on it, and eliminating what doesn't.

## From Engineering to Marketing

I chose to study Automotive Engineering Technology at McMaster University, and
while that might seem like a departure from marketing, it's been the foundation
of how I think about growth.

Engineering taught me to:
- Think in systems, not isolated tactics
- Value precision and measurable outcomes
- Build quality control into every process
- Solve problems methodically

Marketing, on the other hand, taught me to:
- Understand human psychology and behavior
- Communicate complex ideas simply
- Create value that people actually feel
- Build trust through consistency

Together, these disciplines became the foundation of Olunix.

### Olunix Story
```
## Building Olunix

I founded Olunix (formerly GrowByte Media) in the summer of 2024, during the
break before my final year at McMaster. I was 21 years old, had no investors,
and no safety net—just a belief that marketing could be done better.

My CTO and CMO joined me early on, and together we set out to build something
different: a marketing partner that prioritizes doing things well over doing
them fast. That meant saying no to shortcuts, even when they were tempting.
It meant holding ourselves to a standard that most agencies don't bother with.

Today, Olinux works predominantly with AI startups. The companies we partner
with are building the future, and our job is to help them communicate that
vision to the right people at the right time.

We're not just an agency. We're a growth partner.
```

### Current Roles
```

**Final-Year Student at McMaster University**

```

### Personal Section
```
## Beyond Work

I was born in Egypt and moved to Canada when I was eight. Growing up between
two cultures taught me how to adapt quickly, communicate across contexts, and
read people—skills that have become the foundation of my approach to marketing.

When I'm not working or studying, you'll find me exploring Toronto's food scene,
reading about systems thinking, or experimenting with new tech tools.

## Why I Write

I started writing because I believe the best marketers are thinkers, not just
doers. This website and my articles are where I share what I'm learning, what
I'm building, and what I believe matters in a field that's evolving faster than
most can keep up with.

If you've made it this far, thank you. I genuinely appreciate your time.
