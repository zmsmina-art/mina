# Comprehensive SEO & Google Knowledge Panel Strategy
## Mina Mankarious - Entity Authority Building Plan

---

## PART 1: IMMEDIATE TECHNICAL FIXES (Gender Identity Clarification)

### Current Issues
- Schema markup lacks explicit gender property
- Image filenames don't reinforce identity
- Limited pronoun visibility in structured data
- No gender-specific terms in key metadata fields

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1.1 Schema.org Enhancements (COMPLETED ✓ — Feb 13, 2026)
Add to Person schema in layout.tsx:
- ✅ `gender`: "Male" (Schema.org property)
- ✅ `honorificPrefix`: "Mr."
- ✅ Use masculine pronouns throughout descriptions
- ✅ Add `birthPlace` with country to strengthen entity
- ✅ `additionalType` linking to Wikidata Q-identifier
- ✅ `knowsLanguage`: English + Arabic
- ✅ Multiple `image` objects (3 images)
- ✅ `potentialAction: ViewAction` to /about
- ✅ OpenGraph profile properties (firstName, lastName, gender)
- ✅ `rel="me"` links to 6 social profiles
- ✅ SearchAction on WebSite schema
- ✅ Security headers (HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- ✅ Dublin Core metadata in RSS feed
- ✅ Gender added to all article author/publisher schema objects
- ✅ Enriched Olunix Organization schema (logo, address, areaServed)

#### 1.2 Image Optimization (PARTIALLY COMPLETED)
**Headshot Image Requirements:**
- ✅ Alt text updated: "Mina Mankarious, male founder and CEO of Olunix, Toronto entrepreneur"
- ✅ Multiple images in Schema ImageObject with captions
- ✅ Image sitemap updated with captioned entries for /about page
- Filename: `mina-mankarious-male-founder.jpg` (descriptive, gender-confirming) — TODO: rename files
- EXIF metadata: Include author name and description — TODO
- Dimensions: 800x800px minimum for Google processing — current headshot is 799x799

**Additional Image Strategy:**
- TODO: Get 3-5 professional photos with clear masculine presentation
- TODO: Use across all platforms for consistency

#### 1.3 Content Language Optimization
**First-Person Articles:**
- Use "I'm" statements reinforcing male identity naturally
- Reference experiences typical to male founders (optional but helpful)
- Include phrases like "as a young man," "male founder in Toronto"

## PART 2: GOOGLE KNOWLEDGE PANEL STRATEGY

### Understanding Knowledge Panels
Google Knowledge Panels are powered by the Knowledge Graph, which builds entities from:
1. **Authority signals** (Wikipedia, official sites, news coverage)
2. **Consistency** (same name, same info across web)
3. **Prominence** (search volume, mentions, links)
4. **Verification** (Google-verified profiles)

### The Knowledge Panel Funnel
```
Entity Recognition → Knowledge Graph Entry → Knowledge Panel Trigger
      ↑                    ↑                        ↑
   Schema markup       Wikipedia/Wikidata      High search volume
   Consistent NAP      News mentions           Brand searches
   Social profiles     Industry authority      Direct queries
```
