      "Every startup founder asks this question. The answer isn\u2019t either/or \u2014 it\u2019s about sequencing. Here\u2019s a stage-by-stage breakdown of which channel makes sense and when.",
    content: `
This question comes up in almost every founder conversation I have. And like most binary questions in marketing, the answer is more nuanced than either camp wants to admit.

**The short answer: it depends on your stage, your runway, and whether you have time or money.**

The long answer is this article.

## Why This Comparison Matters More Than Ever

The paid ads space is getting expensive. Average CPCs across most industries have risen year-over-year for the last four years running. Meanwhile, AI-generated content has flooded organic search, making it harder to rank without genuine authority. Both channels are more competitive than they were two years ago.

So the founder who says "we'll just run Google Ads" and the founder who says "we'll just do SEO" are both making a mistake. The question isn't which one is better. The question is which one is right for *where you are right now*.

## What Each Channel Actually Does

Let me strip away the jargon.

**Paid ads** (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, etc.) buy you attention. You pay for placement, your ad shows up, and when someone clicks, you pay again. The moment you stop paying, the traffic stops. It's renting space in someone else's system.

**SEO** is building your own infrastructure. You create content, earn authority, and rank in search results. The traffic that comes in isn't paying you rent — it's yours. But building that infrastructure takes time. Months, often over a year, before it compounds meaningfully.

Here's the fundamental tradeoff: **paid ads give you speed. SEO gives you compounding returns.** These aren't interchangeable. They solve different problems at different stages.

## The Stage Framework

### Pre-Product-Market Fit: Neither. Both. Wrong Question.

If you haven't validated that people genuinely want what you're building, [neither channel will save you](/articles/why-most-startups-waste-money-on-marketing). I've said this before and I'll keep saying it because founders keep getting this wrong.

Marketing amplifies what's already working. It doesn't create demand for something people don't want.

At this stage, your job is to talk to people. Do 50 customer interviews. Build something small, put it in front of real humans, and watch what happens. The customer development work you do now will inform every marketing decision you make later — including which channel makes sense and what messaging actually resonates.

**Budget: $0 on both channels.**

### Early Traction (First Real Customers, Proving the Model)

You've got some signal. A handful of customers who are genuinely happy. Some evidence of demand. Now what?

This is where I usually recommend a *small* paid experiment — not as a growth channel, but as a research tool.

Running $500–1,000 in Google Ads against your top 3–4 hypotheses about who your customer is and what they're searching for will teach you more in two weeks than six months of SEO guesswork. You'll find out if your ideal customer is even using search to find solutions like yours. You'll see what copy converts. You'll learn which problem framing resonates.

Then you take those learnings and you *build your SEO strategy on proven data*, not assumptions.

**Budget: $500–1,000/month in paid (research mode). Start producing 2–3 high-quality SEO pieces per month, targeting the keywords your paid experiments validated.**

### Post-PMF, Pre-Series A

Now it starts to get interesting.

By this point, you should have enough data to know two things: who your customer actually is, and what they search for when they're looking for something like you.

This is when SEO starts to make serious economic sense. If your customer acquisition cost through paid is, say, $200, and you can rank for a keyword that brings in customers organically for a one-time content investment of $2,000 — that content pays for itself after 10 customers. After that, every customer from that article is essentially free.

But here's the catch: SEO at this stage takes 6–12 months to materialize. So you can't turn off paid ads while you wait. The play is to run paid to fund the present while SEO builds the future.

**Budget: Maintain proven paid channels. Invest $2,000–5,000/month in SEO (content + technical + links). Expect the SEO flywheel to start turning in 6–9 months.**

### Scaled / Series A+

At this point, if SEO wasn't already a priority, you're behind. And not just a little behind.

Organic search traffic is one of the highest-quality lead sources available because it captures demand that already exists. The person typing "AI legal research tool" into Google is actively looking. They have intent. Compare that to someone who sees your LinkedIn ad — you're interrupting them. You're creating awareness against their will.

The companies that get this right early — the ones that invest in SEO before they "need to" — end up with a distribution moat that's genuinely hard to replicate. It takes time to build domain authority. It takes time to earn backlinks. It takes time for Google to recognize you as a trusted source. You can't shortcut it with budget. You can only shortcut it with time.

**Budget: SEO should be a significant, ongoing investment. Paid is still part of the mix, but increasingly for retargeting and bottom-of-funnel, not awareness.**

## The Honest Case for Paid Ads

I want to be fair here because I just spent several paragraphs making the case for SEO, and that's not the whole picture.

Paid ads have real advantages that SEO can't match:

**Speed.** If you need revenue in 30 days, SEO isn't going to help you. Paid is. Full stop.

**Precision.** You can target by job title, company size, location, interests, and behavior. SEO reaches whoever happens to be searching. Paid reaches exactly who you want to reach.

**Testability.** Paid ads give you instant feedback. You know within days if a message is resonating. SEO takes months to tell you the same thing.

**Scalability.** When you find a paid channel that works, you can scale it by increasing budget. SEO doesn't scale that way — you can't pour more money in and get proportionally more traffic.

For certain business types — particularly those with high LTV, clear ICP, and strong product-market fit — paid ads might always be the primary channel. That's legitimate. Not every business needs to win on organic.

## The Honest Case for SEO

The compounding effect of SEO is hard to overstate. A piece of content that ranks for a valuable keyword can bring in leads every single month for years. The economics look terrible in year one and incredible in year three.

There's also a trust dimension. Organic search results carry implicit credibility that ads don't. When your company shows up at the top of a search result — not in an ad slot — a portion of searchers will give you more benefit of the doubt than they would an ad.

And then there's the volatility argument. Paid channels can change overnight. Google can shift its auction dynamics. Meta can change its algorithm. Your cost-per-click can double in a month. Companies that have built organic authority are insulated from that volatility in a way that paid-dependent businesses simply aren't.

I've seen founders wake up to a 3x increase in their cost per acquisition because of a platform change they had no control over. The ones who'd also invested in SEO could absorb that hit. The ones who hadn't were suddenly in crisis.

## The Question Nobody Asks

Most founders ask "SEO or paid?" when the better question is: **do I have time or money?**

Early-stage founders with limited runway and strong distribution instincts should think about SEO as a long-term investment they start now, while using paid sparingly and strategically to generate immediate learning.

Founders with capital who need to prove growth metrics quickly should lean heavier on paid, but not at the expense of building any organic foundation.

The founders who get into real trouble are the ones who go all-in on paid because it's fast, generate impressive short-term numbers, and then hit a wall when the economics stop working. By that point, they have no SEO foundation to fall back on and no time to build one.

[This is related to the bigger pattern I've written about before](/articles/why-most-startups-waste-money-on-marketing): confusing activity with progress. Running ads feels like marketing. Watching impressions and click-through rates feels like traction. But if the unit economics don't work, you're just accelerating toward the same cliff.

## What I Actually Recommend to Clients

Here's the framework I use at Olunix when a new client asks this question:

**1. What's your time horizon?** If you need revenue in 60 days, start with paid. If you're building for 24 months, start building SEO authority now.

**2. Do you know who your customer is and what they search for?** If yes, start SEO immediately alongside a paid experiment. If no, run paid experiments first to find out.

**3. What are your unit economics?** Calculate what a customer is worth (LTV) and what it costs to acquire them (CAC) through paid. If CAC is greater than LTV/3, your paid channel has a problem and SEO becomes more urgent.

**4. What's your content capability?** SEO requires consistent, high-quality content production. If you don't have the internal capability or budget to produce it, a paid strategy you can execute well will outperform an SEO strategy you execute poorly.

**5. What's your competitive landscape?** If your competitors have 10 years of SEO authority, ranking against them will take years of sustained investment. In that case, paid might be a faster path to visibility while you build organic credibility in adjacent topics where competition is lower.

## The Real Answer

Don't choose. Sequence.

Start with enough paid spend to validate your assumptions and fund the learning you need. Use those learnings to build an SEO strategy grounded in real data. Invest in SEO consistently, even when it feels like nothing is happening. And maintain paid for the channels and use cases where it's provably working.

The startups that win at marketing aren't the ones that picked the right channel. They're the ones that understood how to use each channel [as part of a larger system](/articles/from-engineering-to-marketing-why-systems-thinking-matters), at the right time, for the right purpose.

That's not as satisfying as a definitive answer. But it's the one that actually works.

    excerpt:
      "Before I knew what SEO or CTR meant, I was optimizing Minecraft thumbnails on my parents\u2019 computer. Here\u2019s what a zero-subscriber YouTube channel taught me about marketing.",
    content: `
I\u2019ve been in marketing since I was 10 years old.

I just didn\u2019t know it yet.

## The Channel Nobody Watched

When I was a kid, I started a gaming YouTube channel. Zero subscribers. Big dreams. I was making Minecraft videos, screen recording on my parents\u2019 computer, and uploading them with the genuine belief that this was going to be my thing.

It wasn\u2019t. Not even close.

But something happened during that period that I didn\u2019t appreciate until much later. I got stuck on one question: **why is nobody clicking my videos?**

I didn\u2019t phrase it that way at the time. I was 10. What I actually thought was more like \u201cwhy does this guy with the same game get 50,000 views and I get 12?\u201d Eleven of those views were me, by the way.

## Accidentally Learning the Fundamentals

So I started doing what any obsessive kid would do. I studied.

I looked at what the big creators were doing differently. Their titles were specific. Mine were generic. Their thumbnails had contrast and faces. Mine were blurry screenshots. Their videos hooked you in the first 10 seconds. Mine started with 30 seconds of silence while I figured out the screen recorder.

My dad was so supportive in this. I remember we spent an entire day at the mall trying to find the best microphone for me to use, and I would get so excited to share all of the analytics with him.

I started changing things. New titles. Better thumbnails. Different intros. I\u2019d upload a video, watch the view count for a day, then tweak something and try again.

![My old YouTube channel \u2014 proof that the obsession started early](/youtube-channel-screenshot.png)

And as you can see\u2026 it actually worked. Not millions of views. But enough to prove something important: **small changes in how you present the same content can dramatically change how people respond to it.**

I didn\u2019t know the word \u201coptimization.\u201d I just knew my video with 12 views needed help.

I didn\u2019t know what \u201cclick-through rate\u201d meant. I just knew that some thumbnails made me want to click and others didn\u2019t.

I didn\u2019t know I was doing A/B testing. I just kept changing things until something performed better.

Turns out I was teaching myself SEO, CTR, and content strategy before I ever heard those words.

## The Part Nobody Talks About

Here\u2019s the honest part: I didn\u2019t have the discipline to keep going. I was 10. I got distracted. The channel died. I moved on to the next thing the way every kid does.

But the instinct stayed.

That impulse to look at something that isn\u2019t performing and ask \u201cwhy?\u201d and then actually do something about it \u2014 that never left me. It just went dormant for a while.

When I eventually got into marketing properly, first with small projects, then with [e-commerce clients during COVID](/articles/hi-im-mina), then with [building Olunix](/articles/how-we-rebranded-from-growbyte-to-olunix), it didn\u2019t feel like learning something new. It felt like returning to something I\u2019d already been doing. The vocabulary was different. The stakes were higher. But the core question was the same: **why isn\u2019t this working, and what can I change?**

## Why This Matters More Than You\u2019d Think

I think a lot of people believe marketing is something you learn in a classroom or pick up from a course. And sure, formal education matters. [Systems thinking](/articles/from-engineering-to-marketing-why-systems-thinking-matters) and structured frameworks are valuable.

But the foundation of marketing isn\u2019t technical knowledge. It\u2019s curiosity. It\u2019s the willingness to look at something that isn\u2019t working and be bothered enough to fix it. It\u2019s pattern recognition. It\u2019s empathy \u2014 understanding what makes someone click, watch, stay, or leave.

That kid on his parents\u2019 computer had all of that. He just didn\u2019t have the vocabulary or the discipline.

The vocabulary came later. The discipline came later. But the instinct? That was always there.

## What I\u2019d Tell My 10-Year-Old Self

Keep going.

Not because the YouTube channel was going to blow up. It wasn\u2019t. But because the thing you\u2019re doing right now, the obsessive tinkering, the refusal to accept bad results, the hunger to understand why some things work and others don\u2019t \u2014 that\u2019s not a hobby. That\u2019s a career.

You just don\u2019t know it yet.

I didn\u2019t start my marketing career when I launched my company. I started it on my parents\u2019 computer, trying to outsmart the YouTube algorithm with a Minecraft video and zero subscribers.

And honestly? [I\u2019m still doing the same thing.](/articles/good-content-doesnt-win) The algorithm is just bigger now.

    excerpt:
      "There\u2019s a disconnect between quality content and the stuff that actually goes viral. Is it the algorithm? The platforms? Or something deeper that we\u2019re all complicit in?",
    content: `
There's a question that's been bugging me for a while, and I think it bugs anyone who's ever tried to make something genuinely good on the internet: **why does trash content outperform good content?**

You know what I'm talking about. The rage bait. The AI-generated slop. The "day in my life" videos that are just someone walking through a parking lot with a voiceover about nothing. The posts engineered to make you angry enough to comment, or confused enough to share. That stuff gets millions of views. Meanwhile, someone who spent three weeks on a deeply researched, genuinely valuable piece of content gets 47 likes and a pity comment from their mom.

It's easy to blame the algorithm. And a lot of people do. But I think the answer is more uncomfortable than that.

## The Algorithm Argument

Let's start with the obvious suspect. Social media algorithms are designed to maximize engagement. Not value. Not quality. Not truth. Engagement. And engagement, as it turns out, doesn't correlate with quality. It correlates with emotion.

Content that makes you angry gets shared. Content that makes you anxious keeps you scrolling. Content that's mildly outrageous gets commented on by people who "just can't believe this." The algorithm doesn't know the difference between someone commenting "this changed my life" and someone commenting "this is the worst take I've ever seen." Both are engagement. Both get rewarded.

Meta is currently in trial over exactly this. A lawsuit backed by over 40 state attorneys general accuses Meta of deliberately engineering features \u2014 infinite scroll, auto-play, push notifications, recommendation algorithms \u2014 that make their platforms addictive, particularly to young people. Internal documents allegedly show the company targeted children as an audience while publicly claiming to protect them. Zuckerberg himself took the stand and denied that Instagram was designed to be addictive, saying he's "focused on building a community that is sustainable."

Plaintiff attorneys weren't buying it. Their argument? These companies "built machines designed to addict the brains of children, and they did it on purpose."

Whether the court agrees or not, the accusation itself tells you something important: **the people building these platforms optimized for time spent, not value delivered.** And when you optimize for time spent, the content that wins is the content that keeps people on the app. Not the content that makes them better.

## But Here's Where It Gets Complicated

It's tempting to stop there. "The algorithm is broken, therefore trash content wins." Clean narrative. Easy villain.

But I don't think it's that simple.

Because here's the thing: **not every platform rewards the same behavior.** The kind of content that goes viral on TikTok is fundamentally different from what performs on LinkedIn. What works on X is different from what works on YouTube long-form. The algorithm isn't one monolithic thing. It's a set of incentive structures that vary dramatically across platforms.

On TikTok, the algorithm is discovery-first. It shows your content to strangers. That means the content that wins is the content that captures attention in under two seconds and holds it through novelty, shock, or emotional hijacking. Quality is irrelevant if you can't hook someone before their thumb moves.

On LinkedIn, the algorithm historically rewarded long-form, vulnerable storytelling. "I got fired and here's what I learned" posts outperformed actual business insights for years. LinkedIn has been actively trying to move away from this, but the ecosystem of users trained on engagement bait doesn't change overnight.

On YouTube, watch time is king. Longer videos that keep people watching get pushed harder. That's why 10-minute videos with 2 minutes of actual value and 8 minutes of filler exist. The algorithm doesn't know the information density of the video. It just knows people didn't click away.

So yes, the algorithm matters. But the specific *flavor* of mediocrity it incentivizes depends entirely on the platform. Which tells me the algorithm isn't the root cause. It's a symptom.

## The Ecosystem We Built

Here's what I think the deeper issue is: **we created an ecosystem where content is a commodity, not a craft.**

Think about the sheer volume of content being published every day. Over 500 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute. Millions of posts go up on Instagram daily. The supply of content is functionally infinite.

When supply is infinite, attention becomes the scarce resource. And when attention is scarce, the content that wins isn't the best content. It's the most *attention-efficient* content. The content that delivers the maximum emotional response in the minimum amount of time.

That's not an algorithm problem. That's an economics problem.

We built platforms where anyone can publish. That's genuinely good. The democratization of media creation is one of the most important shifts of our generation. But the side effect is that we flooded the market. And in a flooded market, the loudest voice wins. Not the wisest.

## The Creator's Dilemma

This creates a brutal dilemma for anyone trying to make genuinely good content.

You can spend a week researching, writing, and producing something that actually helps people. Or you can spend 20 minutes recording a hot take that gets 100x the reach. The market is telling you, explicitly, that the hot take is more valuable. Not because it's better. But because it's more efficient at capturing attention.

And here's the part nobody wants to admit: **most people don't want depth.** Not really. They say they do. They share articles about wanting more "meaningful content." But their behavior tells a different story. They scroll past the in-depth analysis and stop on the meme. They skip the 30-minute documentary and watch the 60-second clip. They bookmark the long read and never open it.

I'm not judging. I do it too. We all do. Our brains are wired for novelty and efficiency. Social media didn't create that wiring. It just exploited it at scale.

## So Who's Actually Responsible?

This is where it gets uncomfortable.

**The platforms** are responsible for building systems that optimize for engagement over wellbeing. The Meta lawsuit makes that case clearly. When your recommendation engine actively promotes content that triggers emotional responses because it increases time on platform, you've made a choice. You've decided that ad revenue matters more than the quality of information your users consume.

**The creators** are responsible for playing the game. Every person who posts rage bait, who writes misleading headlines, who manufactures outrage for clicks, is making a choice too. They're choosing reach over integrity. And the ones who are successful at it make it harder for everyone else.

**The audience** is responsible for consuming it. Every view, every comment, every share is a vote. And collectively, we keep voting for the wrong thing.

And **the advertisers** are responsible for funding it. The entire model runs on advertising. Advertisers fund platforms. Platforms optimize for engagement. Engagement rewards low-quality content. Advertisers are indirectly subsidizing the very ecosystem that degrades the attention of the people they're trying to reach.

It's a cycle. And no single actor can break it alone.

## What I Actually Think

I think we're in a transitional period. The cracks are showing. The Meta trial is happening. Regulators are paying attention. Users are starting to feel the exhaustion. There's a growing market for slower, more intentional content \u2014 newsletters, podcasts, long-form YouTube, private communities.

But I don't think the algorithm is going to save us. Even if Meta and YouTube and TikTok completely redesigned their recommendation systems to prioritize "quality" (whatever that means), the fundamental economics haven't changed. Attention is scarce. Content is infinite. And human psychology favors novelty over depth.

What I *do* think is that there's a growing audience of people who are tired. Tired of feeling manipulated. Tired of consuming content that leaves them worse off than before. Tired of the empty calories.

And for creators, especially for brands and founders, that's the opportunity. The same way I've argued that [honesty is a competitive advantage in AI marketing](/articles/how-ai-startups-should-think-about-marketing), I think **substance is becoming a competitive advantage in content.** Not because the algorithm rewards it. But because the people who matter \u2014 the ones who actually buy, who actually stick around, who actually become advocates \u2014 are increasingly the ones who can tell the difference.

Good content doesn't win the algorithm game. But it wins the trust game. And trust is the only game that compounds.

## What This Means If You're Building Something

If you're a founder or a marketer reading this, here's my practical takeaway:

**Stop trying to win the algorithm.** You will lose that race. There will always be someone willing to go lower, post more often, and manufacture more outrage than you. That's not your game.

**Play the long game instead.** Create content that your ideal customer would save, share with a colleague, or reference six months from now. That content won't go viral. But it will build the kind of reputation that [no amount of ad spend can buy](/articles/why-most-startups-waste-money-on-marketing).

**Choose your platform intentionally.** Not every platform deserves your presence. If the incentive structure of a platform fundamentally conflicts with the kind of content you want to create, you're better off not being there. Depth doesn't work everywhere. Find where it does and invest there.

The disconnect between good content and popular content is real. But it's not permanent. And the creators who refuse to compromise on quality now are the ones who'll still be standing when the noise finally fades.

    excerpt:
      "I\u2019ve never cold-called a prospect, never sent a pushy follow-up, never promised the moon to close a deal. Here\u2019s why \u2014 and what happens when you let the work do the talking instead.",
    content: `
I have a confession that would probably get me kicked out of most sales courses: **I don't like selling.**

Not the act of it, exactly. I believe in what we do at Olunix. I believe in the value we create. But the version of selling that most people picture, the cold outreach, the objection handling, the "always be closing" mentality, that's never been me. And I've made a deliberate decision to never let it become me.

Here's why that's worked out better than anyone expected.

## The Anti-Pitch Philosophy

Early on, I watched other agencies and consultants operate. The playbook was always the same: run ads to generate leads, get on a discovery call, spend 45 minutes "handling objections," and close the deal before the prospect has time to think. Then hope the actual delivery lives up to the promises made during the pitch.

That last part is where most of them fall apart.

I decided to flip it. What if instead of spending energy convincing people to hire us, we spent that energy making the work so good that people convinced themselves? What if the pitch *was* the delivery?

It sounds idealistic. Maybe it is. But it's also just math. The cost of acquiring a client through aggressive sales tactics is high. The cost of retaining a client through excellent work is low. And a retained client who refers you to someone else? That's a negative acquisition cost. [You're not spending money. You're saving it.](/articles/why-most-startups-waste-money-on-marketing)

## What This Looks Like in Practice

Let me give you some real examples instead of theory.

When the founder of Reefers Technologies came to us, they needed their website rebuilt. We could have scoped it out, delivered it, and moved on. Instead, we stayed. After-care. Follow-up. Making sure everything ran the way it should long after the invoice was paid.

Here's what he said:

> *"Olunix did an outstanding job rebuilding our website. They were fast to respond to every request, delivered high-quality work on time, and made the entire process smooth from start to finish. What stood out most was their after-care support \u2014 they didn't just hand off the site, they stayed involved to make sure everything ran perfectly."*
> **\u2014 Founder & CEO, Reefers Technologies INC**

Nobody asked us to do that. There was no upsell. No "premium support package." We just didn't want to hand someone a website and disappear. Because that's not how you build a relationship. That's how you complete a transaction.

## When the Work Does Something Unexpected

The founder of Xpomo came to us with a problem I genuinely found exciting: he'd built an AI study app and needed to reach students at scale. TikTok was the obvious channel. But he didn't just need someone to post videos. He needed a growth strategy built from scratch.

So we built one. Together. From the ground up.

> *"Working with Olunix has been a game changer. I was building an AI study app and I needed to find a TikTok growth strategy to reach students. They worked with me to build it out and execute from the ground up, as we received 5m+ views in just a few months. The Olunix guys have amazing energy and deliver results beyond my expectations."*
> **\u2014 Founder, Xpomo.io**

Five million views in a few months. That's a number I'm proud of. But what I'm more proud of is the "worked with me" part. He didn't say "they did it for me." He said they worked *with* him. That distinction matters. We're not a vending machine where you insert money and receive marketing. We're in it together. That's the only way it works.

## Partnerships, Not Transactions

The founder of Wize Consulting needed two things: visibility and connections. Google Ads handled the first part, bringing in consistent, qualified leads. But the second part, connecting him with partners who could actually accelerate his growth, that's not something most agencies even think about.

We did. Because we care about the outcome, not just the deliverable.

> *"Olunix has been a game changer for my consulting startup. Their Google Ads management boosted my visibility and brought in consistent, qualified leads, while their network connections opened doors to high-quality partners that have been invaluable for growth."*
> **\u2014 Founder & Owner, Wize Consulting**

Opening your network for a client isn't in any scope of work. It's not billable. It's not something you can put on a case study slide. But it's the kind of thing that turns a three-month engagement into a long-term partnership. And long-term partnerships are the entire game.

## Why This Matters More Than Ever

We're in an era where [AI is automating execution](/articles/how-ai-startups-should-think-about-marketing) and agencies are getting squeezed on margins. The ones that survive won't be the ones with the best sales decks. They'll be the ones whose clients refuse to leave.

Forrester predicted that agencies will face an identity crisis in 2026, with significant headcount reductions as AI takes over execution work. The firms that make it through are the ones who've built something that can't be automated: **trust.**

You can't automate the decision to stay involved after the project is done. You can't automate a genuine introduction to someone in your network. You can't automate caring about whether your client's business actually grows.

That's the moat. Not the pitch. Not the close rate. Not the funnel. The work.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Sales Culture

I think the reason so many agencies sell hard is because they have to. When your work is average, you need an exceptional pitch. When your delivery is inconsistent, you need a contract that locks people in. When your results are mediocre, you need vanity metrics and [creative reporting to keep clients from leaving](/articles/marketing-vs-consulting-what-startups-need).

I'd rather have the opposite problem. I'd rather have work so good that the sales conversation becomes "here's what we've done for people like you, and here's what they said about it."

That's not a pitch. That's just the truth.

## What I'd Tell a Young Founder About Sales

You don't have to become someone you're not to grow a business. You don't have to learn objection handling or build a 47-step email sequence or pretend to be best friends with someone you met on LinkedIn 30 seconds ago.

You have to be excellent at what you do. You have to care about the people you work with. And you have to trust that when those two things are true, the work will speak louder than any pitch ever could.

That's been the Olunix philosophy from day one. It's not scalable in the way a sales team is. It's not fast in the way paid acquisition is. But it's real. And in a world full of noise, real is the most valuable thing you can be.

    excerpt:
      "From doing nothing with my life during COVID to obsessively building my first company. This one's for the person who thinks they can't do hard things.",
    content: `
There's a version of me from a few years ago that I don't talk about much. Not because I'm ashamed of him, but because he feels like a completely different person. And honestly, that's the whole point of this article.

If you're reading this and you feel like you've wasted too much time, like you're behind, like the gap between where you are and where you want to be is too wide to cross — I wrote this for you.

## The Version of Me Nobody Saw

When COVID hit, I was in a bad place. Not in the dramatic, cinematic way people talk about it on podcasts. In the quiet, invisible way where you just stop doing anything meaningful and convince yourself that's fine.

I wasn't building anything. I wasn't working toward anything. I was just existing, and not in the peaceful, intentional way. In the stuck way. The kind where you know you should be doing more, but you can't figure out what "more" even looks like, so you just don't start.

I think a lot of people felt that during COVID. But for me, it wasn't just the pandemic. It was deeper than that. I genuinely didn't know what I was supposed to be doing with my life. And when you don't have a direction, every day feels the same. You wake up, do nothing that matters, go to sleep, and repeat. And the longer that cycle goes, the harder it becomes to believe you're capable of breaking it.

## The Switch

I can't pinpoint the exact moment it changed. I wish I could give you some movie scene where everything clicked. It wasn't like that. It was more like a slow realization that I was running out of excuses.

And then something happened.

I started. Not because I had some grand vision. Not because I was "ready." I started because the alternative, another year of doing nothing, scared me more than failing.

**I fell in love with the process.**

Not the results. Not the money. Not the validation. The process. The act of doing the work. The late nights figuring out how to make a campaign actually convert. The obsessive tinkering with a landing page until it felt right. The problem-solving. The building.

## The Obsession That Saved Me

People use the word "obsession" like it's unhealthy. And sure, it can be. But for me, it was the opposite. It was the thing that pulled me out.

I became obsessed with getting better. Not in a comparison way, not "better than someone else." Just better than yesterday. I wanted to understand marketing at a level that most people don't bother reaching. I wanted to be precise. I wanted to be excellent. Not for the accolades, but because the pursuit itself felt like the first meaningful thing I'd done in a long time.

If you want a recent example, this website you're on right now has gone through over 30 functional iterations in the past week alone. Thirty. Not because any of them were bad. But because I couldn't stop refining it. I'd finish a version, look at it, and think "this could be better." And then I'd rebuild it. Again. And again.

Some people would call that a waste of time. I call it the reason I'm here at all.

That same energy, that same refusal to settle, is what turned a kid doing nothing during a pandemic into someone [building a company](/articles/hi-im-mina), [working with AI startups](/articles/how-ai-startups-should-think-about-marketing), and writing articles at 1 AM because he genuinely wants to.

## You Just Have to Know It to Be True

I want to be honest about something. My conviction, the deep-down belief that I could actually do hard things, didn't come from a motivational video or a self-help book. It came from my faith. It came from God.

I'm not going to preach at you. That's not what this is. But I'd be lying if I wrote this article about what pulled me through and left that part out. When I had no evidence that things would work out, when every rational indicator said I was behind and under-qualified and out of my depth, there was something deeper that told me to keep going. And I listened.

Whatever that thing is for you, your faith, your family, a promise you made to yourself, hold onto it. Because the world will give you a thousand reasons to quit. You need at least one reason that's stronger than all of them.

## Forget the Gurus

Here's what nobody with a Lamborghini in their thumbnail is going to tell you: **fulfillment doesn't come from the outcome. It comes from the alignment.**

When you find something you can make genuinely fun and exciting, something that pulls you forward instead of something you have to drag yourself through, that's where 90% of fulfillment lives. Not in the revenue milestone. Not in the follower count. Not in the "passive income lifestyle" that someone's selling you for $997.

It's in the work itself. It's in choosing a thing, whether it's a school, a business, a job, a craft, and making it yours. Making it something you care about deeply enough that the hard parts stop feeling like punishment and start feeling like the price of admission to a life you actually want.

I genuinely believe that. I believe that the kid who's scrolling at 2 AM feeling like they've wasted their potential is closer to a breakthrough than they think. Not because of some magic formula. But because the fact that they care, the fact that the gap between where they are and where they want to be actually bothers them, means the fire is already there. It just needs permission to burn.

## What I'd Say to That Person

If you're the person I wrote this for, here's what I want you to hear.

You are not too far gone. You're not too old, too young, too broke, too uneducated, too whatever excuse feels the most convincing right now. The gap between doing nothing and doing something is exactly one decision wide.

You don't need to have it all figured out. I didn't. I just needed to start, and then I needed to fall in love with getting better. That's it. That's the whole strategy.

Pick something. Make it fun. Make it yours. Get obsessive about it. And when people tell you you're doing too much or caring too much or trying too hard, understand that those people have never felt what it's like to be fully alive inside of their work.

The juxtaposition from where I was during COVID to where I am now is so sharp it almost doesn't feel real. But it is. And if it happened for me, it can happen for you.

You just have to know it to be true. And then you have to start.

      "From Egypt to Canada, from engineering to marketing, and everything in between. The story of how a young man's curiosity, hustle, and refusal to cut corners led to building Olunix.",
    content: `
![Mina Mankarious - Founder and CEO of Olunix, Toronto entrepreneur and McMaster University student](/mina-mankarious-headshot.webp)

It's great to have you here, and I'm genuinely grateful you took a second to look around my website. I'm not entirely sure what this article section will look like down the line. Maybe it becomes a place where I share what I'm learning as a young man navigating entrepreneurship, maybe it turns into something completely different. But for now, I figured the best place to start is with a bit about who I am, how I got here, and why I'm writing any of this in the first place.

## Born in Egypt. Raised in Canada. Built by Curiosity.

I was born in Egypt and moved to Canada when I was eight years old. Growing up between two cultures gives you this interesting lens on the world. You learn to read rooms quickly, adapt to new environments, and communicate across different contexts. I didn't realize it at the time, but those were some of the earliest marketing skills I ever developed.

For most of my childhood, I had my heart set on engineering. I loved understanding how things worked, breaking systems down, and building them back up. That never went away. But somewhere in high school, I stumbled into something that lit me up in a completely different way: **marketing**.

Not the "post a flyer and hope for the best" kind. I'm talking about the real stuff. Understanding people, figuring out what makes them care, and then building a bridge between what someone offers and what someone needs. That clicked for me in a way that felt almost instinctive.

## Starting Small, Learning Fast

Like most people, I started with what was right in front of me. I helped friends with their projects. Then people in my close circle. Then small clients who needed someone hungry to figure things out.

Then COVID hit.

And look, I'm not going to romanticize a global pandemic. But what I will say is this: the timing created a unique window. Everybody was buying from home. E-commerce exploded overnight, and suddenly the skills I'd been sharpening for years were in serious demand. I started working with bigger e-commerce clients, and that's where I really started to understand what scalable marketing looks like. Not just getting attention, but **converting it, retaining it, and building systems around it**.

That period taught me more than any textbook ever could.

## Engineering Meets Marketing

I went on to study Automotive Engineering Technology at McMaster University, and I know that might seem like a left turn from marketing. But to me, it works. The heart of Engineering taught me how to think in systems. How to be precise. How to solve problems methodically. Marketing, on the other hand, taught me how to think about people. How to communicate. How to create value that someone actually *feels*. Together, they've become [the foundation of how I build systems](/articles/from-engineering-to-marketing-why-systems-thinking-matters) that serve people.

## Building Olunix

In the summer before my final year, I made a decision that changed everything. I started a company.

My CTO and CMO were with me from early on, and together we set out to do something that sounds simple but turned out to be anything but: **use marketing to create real value in the world.**

It took us a while to figure out what that actually meant. It meant saying no to shortcuts. It meant prioritizing doing things well over doing things fast. It meant hardship, real hardship, in learning to hold ourselves to a standard that most people in this space don't bother with.

But it has been worth it.

We started as GrowByte Media, working with automotive dealerships and dental offices, learning the ins and outs of industries that most marketers overlook. Over time, as our approach matured and our clients evolved, we [rebranded to **Olunix**](/articles/how-we-rebranded-from-growbyte-to-olunix), a name that better reflects who we are today: not just a marketing agency, but a consulting and growth partner.

Today, we work predominantly with AI startups. The companies we partner with are building the future, and our job is to help them get the right message in front of the right people at the right time. It's strategic. It's technical. And it's deeply human.

## Why I\u2019m Writing This

I've always wanted a place to share my two cents on certain topics, but whether because I didn't have the time or couldn't find the right medium, I never got around to it. I'm not going to sit here and pretend like I have something revolutionary, or even insightful to say, but I hope this gives you a glimpse at who I am beyond a simple website showcasing the surface stuff. The blessing and curse of a marketing mind is the constant pull to leverage output, which often leaves less room for genuine thought. Having this platform removes that inclination to appeal to the algorithm entirely.

I started this because I believe the best marketers aren't just practitioners. They're thinkers. They share what they know, they contribute to the conversation, and they're honest about the journey, not just the highlight reel. So that's what I plan to do here. Share what I'm learning, what I'm building, and what I think matters in a world where marketing is evolving faster than most people can keep up with.

If you've made it this far, thank you. I genuinely appreciate your time. I hope this is just the start.

    excerpt:
      "The AI space is crowded, noisy, and full of companies saying the same thing. Here's how the startups that actually win are approaching marketing differently.",
    content: `
At Olunix, we work predominantly with AI startups. It's the space we know best, the space we're most passionate about, and honestly, the space where we see the most marketing dollars go to waste.

So I want to break down what's actually working right now, what's not, and how I think AI startups should be thinking about marketing heading into 2026 and beyond.

## The Problem: Everyone Sounds the Same

Here's the uncomfortable truth. If you're building an AI product right now, you're competing in one of the noisiest markets in history. Every pitch deck says "AI-powered." Every landing page promises to "revolutionize" something. Every founder has a demo that looks impressive for 30 seconds.

The result? **Buyers are skeptical.** And rightfully so.

According to recent research, 62% of consumers say they'd trust brands more if they were transparent about their use of AI. That number tells you everything. People aren't anti-AI. They're anti-BS. They want to know what's real, what actually works, and who they can trust.

## Stop Selling "AI." Start Selling Results.

The most successful AI startups I've worked with have one thing in common: **they don't lead with the technology. They lead with the outcome.**

Nobody cares that you fine-tuned a model. They care that their support tickets get resolved 40% faster. Nobody cares about your architecture diagram. They care that their team saves 10 hours a week.

This sounds obvious, but you'd be surprised how many AI companies still lead their entire marketing strategy with technical jargon that their buyers don't understand and, frankly, don't care about.

The companies winning right now, like Cursor hitting $500M ARR through pure product-led growth, or Harvey scaling to $195M ARR in legal AI, aren't winning because they scream "AI" the loudest. They're winning because they **solve a specific problem for a specific person better than anyone else**, and their marketing reflects that.

## The Channels That Actually Work

Based on what I'm seeing across our clients and the broader market, here's what's actually driving growth for AI startups right now:

**1. Building in public.** Base44, a bootstrapped AI startup, hit 400,000 users and $1M ARR without spending a dollar on ads. How? Their founder posted regular updates, shared technical insights, and built a community around the product. It was acquired by Wix for $80 million in six months. Building in public on LinkedIn proved more effective than any paid channel ever could.

**2. Product-led growth.** Let people try the product. Let them experience the value. Then make upgrading effortless. Cursor's entire growth engine runs on this: developers start free, fall in love, and advocate for team-wide adoption. No cold outreach. No aggressive sales tactics. Just a product so good it sells itself.

**3. Thought leadership that's actually thoughtful.** In a world drowning in AI-generated content, genuine human perspective is the differentiator. The startups that are building trust aren't the ones publishing 50 blog posts a month. They're the ones where the CEO writes one honest piece about a real challenge they faced, and it resonates because it's *real*. This is something I've [seen firsthand working with early clients](/articles/what-i-learned-from-my-first-10-clients).

**4. Community, not campaigns.** The old model of "run ads, capture leads, send emails" is losing effectiveness fast. The AI startups building real competitive moats are the ones building communities. Developer communities. User communities. Ecosystems where people share, learn, and become advocates.

## The Trust Problem Is Your Biggest Marketing Challenge

Here's something most AI founders underestimate: **trust is your moat.**

The technology is increasingly commoditized. Anyone with an API key can build a wrapper. The thing that cannot be commoditized is trust. PwC's 2025 Responsible AI survey found that 60% of business leaders said responsible AI practices boost ROI and efficiency. In 2025 alone, 17 countries enacted or expanded data privacy laws.

What does this mean for marketing? It means transparency isn't just a nice-to-have. It's your competitive advantage. Be honest about what your AI can and can't do. Show the humans behind the product. Publish your methodology. Own your limitations.

The companies that treat trust as a marketing strategy, not just a compliance checkbox, are the ones building lasting brands.

## What I'd Do If I Were Launching an AI Startup Tomorrow

1. **Pick one specific use case and own it completely.** Don't be "AI for everything." Be "AI that does X for Y people better than anything else."
2. **Build in public from day one.** Share your journey, your learnings, your mistakes. It's the highest-ROI marketing channel available to you.
3. **Let the product do the talking.** If people can't experience value in under 5 minutes, your onboarding needs work, not your ad budget.
4. **Invest in content that only you can create.** Your unique perspective, your data, your customer stories. Not generic "Top 10 AI Trends" posts that anyone could write.
5. **Be honest.** In a market full of hype, honesty is the most disruptive thing you can do.

The AI companies that will matter in 5 years aren't the ones with the biggest marketing budgets. They're the ones that earned trust early and never stopped.

    title: "What I Learned Working With My First 10 Clients",
    excerpt:
      "The real lessons from early client work that no business school teaches you. From pricing mistakes to learning when to say no.",
    content: `
Nobody tells you how messy the first few clients actually are. There's no playbook for the moment a client asks you to do something completely outside the scope, or when you realize you've been undercharging by half, or when you have to decide whether a relationship that's paying the bills is worth the stress it's causing.

These are the things I learned the hard way. And honestly, I'm still learning.

## Lesson 1: You Will Underprice Yourself. Accept It, Then Fix It.

When I started taking on clients, I had no idea what to charge. I'd look at what other people were charging, cut it in half because I figured I didn't have enough experience to justify more, and then wonder why I was working 60-hour weeks barely breaking even.

Here's the thing about pricing: **if you're winning almost every deal, you're too cheap.** A healthy close rate is around 25-33%. If you're closing 80-90% of your proposals, you're not pricing based on value. You're pricing based on fear.

It took me longer than I'd like to admit to learn that. The fix wasn't just raising prices. It was understanding what I was actually delivering. When you shift from selling hours to selling outcomes, the pricing conversation changes entirely.

## Lesson 2: Scope Creep Will Eat You Alive If You Let It

Early on, I said yes to everything. A client would ask for "one more thing" and I'd do it because I wanted to be accommodating. I wanted them to like working with me. I wanted to prove I was worth it.

What I didn't realize was that every "quick favor" was training clients to expect free work. And the more I gave, the more they expected.

The solution wasn't becoming rigid or difficult. It was getting better at defining what's included upfront and having honest conversations when requests go beyond that. The best client relationships I've had are the ones with the clearest boundaries. Not because boundaries are cold, but because they create space for trust.

## Lesson 3: Not Every Client Is Your Client

This was probably the hardest lesson. When you're starting out, every client feels essential. Every dollar matters. So you take on work that doesn't align with your strengths, for people whose communication style drains you, in industries you have no interest in.

I learned to look for red flags early:
- They negotiate aggressively on price before understanding the value
- They can't articulate what success looks like
- They want everything but commit to nothing
- They treat you like a vendor, not a partner

Saying no to a paying client when you're early-stage feels terrifying. But the opportunity cost of a bad client is enormous. They take up the time, energy, and headspace that should be going toward work that actually moves your business forward.

## Lesson 4: Communication Is the Whole Game

The technical skills, the strategies, the creative work, all of that matters. But the thing that separates a good client experience from a bad one is almost always communication.

I learned to over-communicate. Not in a neurotic way, but in a way that makes clients feel like they're never in the dark. Weekly updates. Clear timelines. Honest conversations when something isn't working.

The clients I've kept the longest aren't the ones I delivered the flashiest results for. They're the ones who felt heard, respected, and informed throughout the process.

## Lesson 5: Your Early Clients Shape Your Entire Business

Looking back, the first 10 clients didn't just pay the bills. They shaped the direction of the company.

Working with automotive dealerships taught me how to market in traditional industries that resist change. Working with dental offices taught me the importance of local SEO and reputation management. Working with e-commerce clients during COVID taught me scalable systems. These experiences also shaped [how I think about startup marketing spend](/articles/why-most-startups-waste-money-on-marketing) today.

Every one of those experiences became part of the foundation we built Olunix on. The industries have changed, we predominantly work with AI startups now, but the principles haven't.

**Your early clients are your education.** Treat them that way. Learn everything you can from every engagement, even the ones that go sideways. Especially the ones that go sideways.

## Lesson 6: The Transition From Doing to Leading

There's a moment every agency owner hits where you realize you can't do everything yourself. For me, it happened when I was writing copy at 2 AM on a Tuesday for the third week in a row.

The shift from doer to leader is uncomfortable. You go from being the person who touches every deliverable to the person who builds systems so other people can deliver. It feels like giving up control. It feels risky.

But it's the only way to build something bigger than yourself. And the sooner you make that shift, the sooner your business stops being a glorified freelance operation and starts being an actual company.

## What I'd Tell Someone Starting Today

Start with what's in front of you. Help the people in your immediate circle. Charge more than you think you should. Set boundaries early. Say no to work that doesn't feel right, even when you need the money. And document everything, because the lessons from your first 10 clients will inform the next 100.

    title: "Why Most Startups Waste Money on Marketing (And How to Fix It)",
    excerpt:
      "74% of startups fail due to premature scaling. Here's what that actually means for your marketing budget and how to spend smarter, not more.",
    content: `
I've seen it too many times. A startup raises a seed round, immediately allocates a huge chunk to marketing, hires an agency or a growth marketer, runs a bunch of ads, and three months later has nothing to show for it except a lighter bank account and a vague sense that "marketing doesn't work."

Marketing works. It's just that most startups are doing it at the wrong time, in the wrong way, for the wrong reasons.

## The Numbers Are Brutal

Let me hit you with some data that should make every founder pause.

The Startup Genome Project studied over 3,200 high-growth tech startups and found that **74% of failures are caused by premature scaling**. That includes premature marketing spend. Startups that scale properly grow about **20x faster** than those that scale prematurely. And 93% of startups that scale prematurely never break $100K in monthly revenue.

On the marketing side specifically, research shows that **marketers waste about 26% of their total budget** on average. For SMEs, that number jumps to nearly **60%**. Google has admitted that up to 56% of display ads are never even seen by a human.

So when I say most startups waste money on marketing, I'm not being dramatic. The data backs it up.

## The 5 Most Common Ways Startups Burn Through Budget

### 1. Spending Before Product-Market Fit

This is the big one. If you haven't validated that people genuinely want what you're building, no amount of marketing spend will fix that. Marketing amplifies what's already working. It doesn't create demand for something nobody wants.

Before you spend a dollar on ads, you should be able to answer: Who is this for? Why do they care? And are they willing to pay?

### 2. Spreading Across Too Many Channels

I get the temptation. You want to be on Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, run Google Ads, do SEO, start a podcast, maybe some PR. But spreading your budget across 8 channels guarantees mediocre results everywhere and excellence nowhere.

**Focus on 2-3 channels maximum.** Master them. Prove they work. Then expand.

### 3. Chasing Vanity Metrics

If your marketing report is full of impressions, follower counts, and website traffic but doesn't mention conversion rates, customer acquisition costs, or revenue, you're measuring the wrong things.

Vanity metrics make you feel good. Business metrics keep you alive.

### 4. Hiring Too Early

A lot of founders rush to hire a head of marketing or a growth hacker before they even understand their own positioning. Without clear messaging, defined ideal customers, and a strategy, even a talented marketer will struggle.

Most startups pre-Series A should be doing **founder-led marketing**. Nobody knows your product and customers better than you do. Once you've identified what works, *then* hire someone to scale it. I wrote more about [when to hire externally vs. build in-house](/articles/marketing-vs-consulting-what-startups-need).

### 5. Confusing Activity With Progress

Posting three times a day on LinkedIn. Sending weekly newsletters. Publishing blog posts. All of these *can* be valuable. But if they're not tied to a strategy with clear goals, they're just busywork that makes you feel productive while your competitors are actually converting customers.

## What Smart Startups Do Instead

The startups that spend wisely have a few things in common.

**They do things that don't scale first.** Before Airbnb ran any ads, their founders went door to door in New York helping hosts improve their listings. Before Stripe built a sales team, the Collison brothers would physically take people's laptops and install Stripe on the spot. These unscalable efforts taught them more about their customers than any campaign ever could.

**They obsess over unit economics.** They know exactly what it costs to acquire a customer (CAC), what that customer is worth over time (LTV), and they don't scale spend until LTV is at least 3x CAC.

**They build referral loops.** Dropbox grew 3,900% in 15 months through a referral program that cost essentially nothing. Both the referrer and the friend got 500MB of free storage. It worked because it incentivized behavior users were already doing naturally: sharing files.

**They focus on retention before acquisition.** The probability of selling to an existing customer is 60-70%. For a new prospect, it's 5-20%. Yet most startups pour the majority of their budget into acquisition and neglect the customers they already have.

## The Framework I Use With Clients

When a startup comes to us at Olunix, the first thing I do is assess where they actually are, not where they think they are.

**Pre-product-market fit?** We focus on messaging, positioning, and learning. Small experiments. Talking to customers. Zero paid spend.

**Early traction?** We identify the 1-2 channels showing the most promise and invest deeply in those. We set up proper tracking so every dollar can be attributed to an outcome.

**Post-PMF with revenue?** Now we scale. Paid acquisition, content systems, and partnerships, but only with proven unit economics backing every decision.

The sequencing matters. Most of the waste I see comes from startups trying to execute a growth-stage playbook when they're still in learning mode.

## The Bottom Line

Marketing isn't a lottery ticket. It's a system. And like any system, it works best when you build it on a solid foundation.

Stop spending money to feel like you're making progress. Start spending money because you've proven something works and you're ready to pour fuel on it.

That's the difference between startups that scale and startups that stall.

I started Olunix during the summer before my final year at McMaster University. At the time, I was 21, had no investors, no office, and no safety net. Just an idea, a CTO and CMO who believed in it, and a city that turned out to be one of the best places in the world to build something from scratch.

## Why Toronto Is Special

I'm biased, but I genuinely believe Toronto is one of the best cities to start a business, especially if you're young and scrappy.

The numbers back it up. Toronto's population is over 2.9 million, with more than 200 languages spoken. Over 51% of Toronto residents were born outside of Canada. That kind of diversity isn't just a nice statistic for a brochure. It's a **business advantage**.

When your city speaks 200 languages and represents every corner of the world, you have a built-in testing ground for products and services that need to work across cultures. You have access to perspectives and networks that founders in more homogeneous markets simply don't.

The tech ecosystem is strong too. Toronto is home to world-class AI research at the University of Toronto, a thriving startup scene, and growing venture capital infrastructure. Companies like Shopify, Wealthsimple, and dozens of AI startups have built significant businesses here.

## The McMaster Advantage

I'll be honest: when I tell people I'm studying Automotive Engineering Technology and running a marketing company, I get some confused looks. But McMaster has been a bigger part of my entrepreneurial journey than most people realize.

McMaster has The Forge, a business incubator that's been supporting startups since 2015. It's located in a 10,000-square-foot space at McMaster Innovation Park and provides mentorship, business development support, and access to investors and industry experts. They run year-long commercialization programs for early-stage ventures across biotech, digital health, mobility, and more.

Beyond formal programs, the university environment itself is valuable. You're surrounded by smart people across every discipline. You have access to libraries, research, professors who've been in industry for decades, and a built-in network of peers who are going through the same thing you are.

## The Honest Challenges

Let me be real about what's hard.

**Time management is brutal.** You're not just juggling a business and school. You're juggling a business, school, assignments, group projects, maybe a part-time job, and some attempt at having a life. There were weeks where I slept 4-5 hours a night because a client deliverable was due the same day as a midterm. I don't recommend it. But it happens.

**Credibility is an uphill battle.** When you're 21 and sitting across from a potential client who's been in business for 20 years, they're going to wonder whether you can actually deliver. I learned to let the work speak for itself. I stopped trying to *seem* experienced and just focused on *being* good. Over time, the results built the credibility that my age couldn't.

**The money stress is real.** Starting a business is expensive, even a service-based one. There were months early on where I was reinvesting every dollar back into the company and living on the bare minimum. Toronto isn't cheap, and being a student doesn't make it cheaper.

## Resources That Actually Help

If you're a student in Ontario thinking about starting something, here are resources worth knowing about:

**Ontario Summer Company Program.** The provincial government offers up to $3,000 in grants for students between 15-29 who want to start a summer business. It's split into two payments: up to $1,500 for startup costs and another $1,500 upon completion. Applications typically open in February.

**NRC IRAP.** The Industrial Research Assistance Program offers small and medium businesses up to 60-80% reimbursement for R&D expenses, capped at $500,000. It operates on a continuous intake basis, so there's no single deadline.

**CanExport SMEs.** If you're looking to take your business international, this program offers up to $50,000 in funding for export-related activities.

**Small Business Enterprise Centres.** Toronto and surrounding cities have free resources through local enterprise centres, including mentoring, workshops, and networking events.

## What I Wish I'd Known Earlier

**Start as a sole proprietorship.** When you're just getting going and your revenue is under $30,000, you probably don't need to incorporate right away. A sole proprietorship is simpler, cheaper, and gets you moving faster. You can always incorporate later as you grow.

**Build in public.** Share what you're doing, even when it feels premature. The people who follow your journey early become your biggest supporters, and often your first clients. That's exactly [what we did when building Olunix](/articles/how-we-rebranded-from-growbyte-to-olunix).

**Find your people.** Entrepreneurship is lonely enough without trying to do it in isolation. Whether it's other student founders, a local meetup, or an online community, surround yourself with people who understand what you're going through.

**Don't wait until you're "ready."** You won't be. I wasn't. Nobody is. The best time to start is when you have the lowest overhead and the highest risk tolerance, and for most people, that's while you're still in school.

## The Immigrant Advantage

I was born in Egypt and moved to Canada when I was eight. Growing up between two cultures taught me how to adapt, communicate across different contexts, and read people quickly. I didn't realize it at the time, but those skills became the foundation of everything I do in marketing.

Toronto's diversity isn't just cultural richness. It's a business superpower. If you grew up navigating multiple cultures, you already have skills that most marketers spend years trying to develop. Don't underestimate that.

## Final Thoughts

Building a business as a student in Toronto is hard. But it's the kind of hard that makes you better. The constraints force creativity. The pressure builds resilience. And the city gives you everything you need to succeed, if you're willing to put in the work.

If you're on the fence, just start. The worst thing that happens is you learn more in a year of building something than most people learn in a decade of thinking about it.

    title: "Marketing vs. Consulting: What Early-Stage Startups Actually Need",
    excerpt:
      "Agency, consultant, or in-house? The answer depends on your stage, your budget, and what problem you're actually trying to solve.",
    content: `
One of the most common questions I get from founders is some version of: "Should we hire a marketing agency, bring someone in-house, or just get a consultant?"

My answer is always the same: it depends on where you are.

I know that's unsatisfying. So let me break down what I actually mean, based on what I've seen work (and not work) across dozens of early-stage companies.

## The Real Difference Between Agencies, Consultants, and Consulting Firms

These three get lumped together constantly, but they serve fundamentally different purposes.

**A marketing agency** is a team that **executes**. They run your ads, manage your social, build your website, produce your content. You hire them to do the work.

**A marketing consultant** is an individual (or small team) that **advises**. They audit your current efforts, develop strategy, create frameworks. You hire them to think.

**A consulting firm** operates at the intersection of business strategy and marketing. They work with leadership to solve business problems through a marketing lens. You hire them to decide *why* and *how* marketing fits into the bigger picture.

Here's the key distinction: **Agencies answer "How do we execute this?" Consultants answer "What should we do?" Consulting firms answer "Why should we do it?"**

At Olunix, we've intentionally built something that sits across these lines, because most startups need a partner who can think strategically *and* execute. But more on that later.

## What You Need at Each Stage

### Pre-Product-Market Fit

**What you need:** Almost nothing external. This is founder-led marketing territory.

At this stage, your job is to talk to potential customers, validate your messaging, and figure out what resonates. You don't need an agency running Facebook ads. You need 50 conversations with real people who might buy what you're building.

If you need any outside help at all, a consultant for a specific question, maybe 2-3 hours of their time to gut-check your positioning, is plenty. **Budget: $0-$2,000/month.**

### Early Traction

**What you need:** A fractional CMO or senior consultant, plus maybe one freelancer.

You've got some signal that people want what you're building. Now you need strategic direction. A fractional CMO gives you senior marketing leadership at $4,000-$8,000/month instead of the $250,000-$500,000 salary a full-time CMO would cost.

This person helps you define your ideal customer, nail your positioning, and identify which 1-2 channels deserve your attention. They might also help you manage a freelancer or two for execution. **Budget: $5,000-$12,000/month.**

### Post-PMF, Pre-Series A

**What you need:** Strategic leadership + execution support + one in-house person.

This is where most startups should consider engaging an agency, but only for specific channels where you've already proven traction. Don't hand an agency your entire marketing strategy if you haven't figured out what works yet. That's setting them up to fail and yourself up to waste money.

The ideal setup: fractional CMO for strategy, an agency for 1-2 proven channels (paid acquisition, SEO, content), and one in-house generalist who maintains institutional knowledge. **Budget: $10,000-$25,000/month.**

## The Red Flags Nobody Talks About

Whether you're evaluating an agency, consultant, or fractional CMO, watch for these:

**They guarantee results.** "We'll get you to #1 on Google in 3 months" is a lie. Anyone who guarantees specific outcomes in marketing either doesn't understand the work or is counting on you not knowing better.

**They don't ask hard questions.** If someone starts pitching a solution before deeply understanding your business, your customers, and your competitive landscape, they're selling a template, not a partnership.

**They focus on vanity metrics.** If their case studies emphasize follower counts and impressions rather than revenue, leads, or customer acquisition costs, their incentives don't align with yours.

**They push long contracts.** A 12-month lock-in with no performance benchmarks is a sign they know clients would leave if they could. Look for 90-day initial commitments with clear success criteria.

**They don't push back on you.** This is counterintuitive, but a good partner should challenge your assumptions. If they just say yes to everything, they're order-takers, not strategic partners.

## The Industry Is Changing Fast

Here's something worth understanding about the broader landscape. Forrester predicted that marketing agencies will face an "identity crisis" in 2026, with a 15% reduction in headcount following 8% cuts in 2025. AI is automating execution work. Procurement pressure is squeezing margins. Clients want partners, not vendors.

The old model of "you brief us, we make the thing" is dying. The agencies that survive will be the ones that evolve into true growth partners, ones that own strategy *and* execution, measure by business outcomes, and embed themselves into their clients' operations.

That shift is exactly why we built Olunix the way we did. We're not just an agency. We're not just consultants. We're a growth partner for companies building the future. That means we [think in systems](/articles/from-engineering-to-marketing-why-systems-thinking-matters), execute tactically, and measure by the only metric that matters: did we create real value?

## The Bottom Line

Don't hire an agency because you think it's what you're supposed to do. Don't hire a consultant because someone on Twitter said you should. And don't build an in-house team before you can afford to.

Hire based on where you actually are, what you actually need, and what you can actually measure. Everything else is noise.

    title: "From Engineering to Marketing: Why Systems Thinking Matters",
    excerpt:
      "How studying Automotive Engineering at McMaster shaped the way I think about marketing, and why the best marketers think more like engineers than creatives.",
    content: `
People always ask me how I ended up in marketing with an engineering background. They treat it like a career change. For me, it's the same career. Just applied differently.

I study Automotive Engineering Technology at McMaster University. I also run a marketing and consulting firm. And honestly, the engineering mindset is the single biggest competitive advantage I have in marketing.

Let me explain why.

## Marketing Is a System

Most people think of marketing as a creative discipline. Coming up with clever campaigns, writing catchy copy, designing beautiful visuals. And sure, creativity matters. But at its core, **marketing is a system**. It has inputs, processes, outputs, and feedback loops, just like any engineering system.

Think about a marketing funnel. Traffic comes in (input). That traffic moves through stages of awareness, consideration, and decision (process). Some percentage converts into customers (output). You measure the results and optimize (feedback loop).

That's not creative work. That's systems engineering.

The best marketers I know don't just have good instincts. They have good frameworks. They understand cause and effect. They can isolate variables, run tests, and iterate based on data. Sound familiar? It should. That's the scientific method. That's engineering.

## What Engineering Actually Taught Me

### Precision Matters

In engineering, tolerances exist for a reason. A part that's off by a millimeter might not fit. A calculation that's off by one decimal might cause failure.

Marketing has its own version of precision. The difference between a 2% conversion rate and a 4% conversion rate might not sound like much, but it could mean doubling your revenue without spending an extra dollar on traffic. The precise word choice in a headline. The exact placement of a call-to-action. The specific audience targeting in an ad campaign.

Small differences compound into massive outcomes. Engineering taught me to care about the details that most marketers gloss over.

### Systems Thinking Changes Everything

Engineering doesn't teach you to solve isolated problems. It teaches you to understand how parts of a system interact. When you change one component, what happens to the rest?

In marketing, this is critical. Your ad copy affects your click-through rate, which affects your cost per click, which affects your customer acquisition cost, which affects your profitability. It's all connected. If you optimize one piece without understanding the system, you might improve one metric while destroying another.

The marketers who build sustainable growth engines aren't the ones with the best creative ideas. They're the ones who understand the entire system and optimize it holistically.

### The Concept of Quality Control

Engineering has rigorous quality standards. You test. You measure. You validate. You don't ship something that hasn't been stress-tested.

Most marketing teams ship campaigns based on gut feeling and hope for the best. They don't A/B test. They don't establish baselines. They don't have clear quality criteria for what "good" looks like.

Applying engineering-level quality control to marketing, defining success metrics before launch, testing variations systematically, documenting what works and why, is one of the simplest ways to reduce waste and improve results.

## Growth Engineering Is a Real Discipline

This isn't just my personal philosophy. There's a whole discipline called **growth engineering** that sits at the intersection of engineering and marketing.

Chamath Palihapitiya assembled a growth team at Facebook in 2008 when the platform had plateaued at 90 million users. His team combined engineering, data science, and marketing to identify that getting a new user to 7 friends in 10 days was the key to retention. That insight, discovered through systems analysis, helped grow Facebook to nearly a billion users.

Sean Ellis, who coined the term "growth hacking," applied the same engineering mindset at Dropbox and LogMeIn. He didn't just run creative campaigns. He built systems that identified growth levers, tested hypotheses, and scaled what worked.

Today, companies like Productboard and Atlassian have dedicated growth engineering teams. These are cross-functional groups of engineers, designers, and product managers who approach growth with the rigor of a technical discipline.

Scott Brinker, known as the "Godfather of MarTech," started the Chief Martec blog in 2008 with a core premise: **marketing has become a technology-powered discipline, and marketing organizations must infuse technical capabilities into their DNA.** The distinction between marketing and technology is gone.

## How I Apply This at Olunix

Every engagement at Olunix starts with systems thinking. Before we touch creative, before we run a single ad, we map the system:

- Where are customers coming from?
- What's happening at each stage of the funnel?
- Where are the bottlenecks?
- What are the feedback loops?
- What data do we have, and what data do we need?

Then we build. Test. Measure. Iterate. It's not glamorous. But it works.

The companies we partner with, mostly [AI startups](/articles/how-ai-startups-should-think-about-marketing), appreciate this approach because they think the same way. They're building technical products. They expect their marketing partner to be equally rigorous.

## Why This Matters for the Future of Marketing

Marketing is becoming more technical every year. The rise of marketing automation, analytics platforms, AI tools, and data-driven decision-making means the marketers who thrive in the next decade will be the ones who can think in systems.

If you come from a technical background and you're curious about marketing, lean into that. Your ability to think analytically, build frameworks, and optimize systems is exactly what the marketing world needs more of.

And if you're a marketer who's never thought of yourself as technical, start learning. Pick up basic analytics. Understand how A/B testing works. Learn to read data. The creative instinct is valuable, but pairing it with systems thinking is what separates good marketing from great marketing.

The best marketing doesn't feel like marketing. It feels like engineering applied to people.

    title: "How We Rebranded From GrowByte to Olunix",
    excerpt:
      "The real story behind our rebrand: why we did it, what we learned, and the practical steps of changing your company's identity without losing what matters.",
    content: `
In the summer of 2024, we made a decision that felt massive at the time: we killed GrowByte Media and became Olunix.

If you've ever rebranded a company, you know it's not as simple as changing a logo. It touches everything. Your website, your messaging, your client relationships, your sense of identity. It's equal parts exciting and terrifying.

I want to walk you through exactly why we did it, how we did it, and what I'd do differently if I had to do it again.

## Why We Rebranded

GrowByte Media was the name we launched with. It served us well in the beginning. It was descriptive: "Grow" + "Byte" communicated digital growth. Simple enough.

But as we evolved, the name started to hold us back.

**We outgrew the name.** GrowByte sounded like a marketing agency that runs Facebook ads. We were becoming something bigger: a consulting and growth partner for companies building the future. The name didn't reflect the scope of [what we were doing](/articles/what-i-learned-from-my-first-10-clients).

**It limited perception.** When we'd get on calls with AI startup founders, they'd assume we were a traditional digital marketing shop. We'd spend the first 15 minutes of every call explaining that we were more than that. Your name is supposed to open doors, not create additional hurdles.

**We moved upmarket.** Our clients evolved from local businesses to funded startups. The brand needed to match the caliber of the companies we were partnering with.

Research shows that 57% of companies rebrand to update their identity, and 45% rebrand to reposition in the market. We were both.

## Choosing the Name "Olunix"

Naming a company is harder than it sounds. You want something that's memorable, easy to pronounce, has an available domain, and doesn't mean something offensive in another language. That eliminates about 99% of options.

We explored three categories of names:

**Descriptive names** (like GrowByte) tell you exactly what a company does. They're easy to understand but hard to differentiate and nearly impossible to trademark.

**Suggestive names** (like Nike or Uber) hint at what you do without saying it directly. They create emotional connections and are more trademarkable.

**Coined names** (like Verizon or Spotify) are completely made up. They're unique and highly trademarkable, but they require more investment to build meaning.

Olunix is a coined name. It doesn't mean anything in any language, which was intentional. We wanted a blank canvas, a name whose meaning would be defined entirely by the work we do and the reputation we build. Research suggests coined names work best when the brand will be around for a long time and has the commitment to invest in building recognition.

We tested it with the "phone test": could someone hear the name once and spell it correctly? Could they find us online? Could they say it naturally in conversation? Olunix passed.

## The Practical Steps

Here's the actual process we followed:

**Phase 1: Strategy (Month 1).** Before touching any visuals, we defined who we were becoming. What's our positioning? Who are we for? What do we want people to feel when they hear our name? This phase was all conversations: with each other, with trusted clients, and with mentors.

**Phase 2: Naming and Identity (Months 2-3).** We brainstormed names, checked trademark availability, secured the domain, and developed the visual identity. The logo, colors, typography, all of it needed to communicate what GrowByte couldn't: sophistication, strategic thinking, and a forward-looking perspective.

**Phase 3: Client Communication (Month 3).** This was the part I was most nervous about. We reached out to every active client personally, not via a mass email, but through individual calls and messages. We explained the why, reassured them that the team, the quality, and the approach weren't changing, and gave them space to ask questions.

Not a single client raised concerns. In fact, most of them said something like "Yeah, this makes more sense for what you guys do."

**Phase 4: Digital Migration (Month 4).** Website, social media, email addresses, directory listings, invoicing, everything got updated. We set up 301 redirects from the old domain to ensure SEO continuity. This part is tedious but critical. 42% of domain migrations never fully recover their original traffic levels if redirects aren't handled properly.

**Phase 5: Launch and Reinforcement (Month 5+).** We announced the rebrand publicly, updated all remaining collateral, and spent the following weeks reinforcing the new identity through content and outreach.

## What I'd Do Differently

**I'd budget more time for the naming phase.** We moved quickly because we were excited, but I wish we'd tested the name with a broader group before committing. The more feedback you get early, the fewer surprises later.

**I'd separate the brand change from the website redesign.** We did both simultaneously, which made it harder to track what was affecting what. If possible, do them sequentially so you can isolate the impact of each change.

**I'd communicate with clients even earlier.** We told clients about a month before the switch. In hindsight, I'd give key clients 2-3 months of heads-up and involve them in the process. They appreciate being part of the journey, not just informed of the outcome.

## Was It Worth It?

Absolutely. The rebrand wasn't just cosmetic. It was a statement about who we are and where we're going. Since becoming Olunix, the quality of inbound inquiries has changed. The conversations are different. Potential clients come in expecting a strategic partner, not just a marketing vendor.

The lesson here isn't that every company should rebrand. Most shouldn't. But if your brand is actively limiting how people perceive you, if you're constantly explaining what you actually do because your name gives the wrong impression, it might be time.

A rebrand isn't a distraction. It's an investment. But only if the story behind it is real.
